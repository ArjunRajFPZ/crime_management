<p>Safety Tips for In Your Car</p>
<p>Have your car keys in hand when approaching your vehicle.<br>
Look under the car as you approach it to be sure no one is hiding under it.<br>
If a person gets near your vehicle causing concern, turn around and walk away.<br>
Consider attaching a loud whistle to your key chain so you can use it if necessary.<br>
Look in the back seat before getting the into car; be sure no one is hiding there, even if you locked the door earlier.<br>
After entering your vehicle, immediately lock all doors.<br>
When possible, try to avoid parking your vehicle in dark, isolated areas.<br>
If your hands are full of bags, consider asking for a security escort from the store, mall, or grocery staff. Be aware of your surroundings when placing items in the trunk, you are more of a target when distracted.<br>
When dealing with children and car seats, it is better to put them in the seat, then get in yourself, lock the doors, and then finish buckling the kids up. This keeps you safer and allows you to give your full attention to handling the kids.<br>
Lock personal property in the trunk of the car if you cannot take it with you. Do not leave such items as your purse, electronics, laptops or cell phones in view or on seats.<br>
Keep plenty of gas in your car and keep the car in good running order. If you should have car trouble, raise the hood, lock yourself in and wait for the police. If someone stops and offers help, stay in your car and ask that person to call for help for you; a relative, a friend or the police.<br>
When driving alone at night, let a family member or friend know the route you take and your expected arrival time at your destination.<br>
Exercise common sense, and be aware of your surroundings.<br>
Have a plan in place to deal with a violent situation if it should occur.<br>
Report all suspicious persons and/or activity to the UAB Police.<br>
