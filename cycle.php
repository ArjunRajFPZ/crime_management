<p>Bicycle Safety Tips </p>
<p>Properly securing your bicycle with a quality lock will reduce a crime of opportunity. Thieves know this and have figured out that stealing bikes and bike parts can be a lucrative business. If you own a bicycle, use a sturdy, good quality U-lock. A cable or chain lock is very vulnerable and easily defeated. The U-lock is sold in most bicycle stores.<br>

Go with the flow of traffic.<br>
Before turning, stopping, or leaving a lane, give the proper hand signal.<br>
Wear a helmet at all times when riding a bicycle.<br>
Use a bike light when riding a bicycle at night.<br>
