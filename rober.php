<p>Tips to Keep You Safe In The Event of a Robbery</p>
<p>Money can be replaced: Money is only a material thing and isn’t worth losing your life. If you are being robbed, hand over the money. Give robbers what they want.<br>
Being robbed may be one of the scariest things that you will ever face. It’s important to remain calm and don’t show fear. Do not hold anything back. This may save your life. Upsetting the robber is the last thing you want to do!<br>
Try to keep calm and remind yourself that you can’t be replaced.  Make a mental note of their appearance.<br>
This could be an event that you will remember for the rest of your life; however, everything that you remember about the person can help the police in their investigation. The Police will want to know what they were wearing, shoes, facial appearance, scars, tattoos, hair color, eye color, and anything else that would make this person stand out. Immediately call the Police after the robbery.<br>
