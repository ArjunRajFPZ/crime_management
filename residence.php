<p>Safety Tips for In Your Residence </p>
<p>Be alert when returning home by having your key ready as you approach the door; in addition, if you think someone is inside, donâ€™t go in! Call the police from a nearby phone.<br>
If possible, equip your house or apartment door with a peephole and dead bolt lock with a one-inch bolt.<br>
Never open your door to strangers.<br>
 Request identification from all repair or service personnel, and verify the identity before letting them in, especially if you have not called for repairs.<br>
Use outside lighting whenever possible.<br>
Never hide your door key in a flowerpot or under a mat. In fact, don't hide your door key anywhere outside your residence.<br>
Make certain your door is locked whenever you leave, even if only for a short time.<br>
When you are away, inform a trusted neighbor of your travel plans. Have them collect mail and other deliveries. Leave shades in their normal positions. If possible, two or more lights on a timer. Use them daily, not just when you're away.<br>
