Avoid getting overfriendly with strangers.<br>

While part of the excitement of travel is making new friends and talking to fellow travelers, never ever divulge your plans or itinerary to anyone.<br>

Never stay out late at night especially at strange places.<br>

Do not wear expensive jewelry or odd clothes while traveling as it may attract burglars.<br>

Try to carry cell phone along with you while traveling so that you can contact someone in case of emergency.<br>

Prefer wearing money belts and hidden pouches under your clothes to avoid pick pocketing.<br>

While staying at hotels, always keep your door locked whenever you are in your room. For added safety, keep the safety chain on to prevent any forced entry.<br>

Before opening the door to anyone, use the peephole. If the person is not in a hotel uniform or looks suspicious, do not open the door. Be wary of revealing your identity on the telephone, especially if you are traveling alone.<br>

You are a tourist but you don't need to let the whole world know that. Don't look like a tourist. Looking at maps in your car or on the street is a dead give-away. A camera hanging around your neck all the time is also not a sound idea.<br>

Don't flash money around. Just keep enough to meet your immediate needs. When traveling, your best protection is to be knowledgeable and alert. To travel with confidence and a positive attitude.
