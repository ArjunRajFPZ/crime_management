<p>Safety Tips for When Walking</p>
<p>Be alert and aware of your surroundings.<br>
Consider carrying a noise-making device with you at all times, and use it if you suspect you are in danger.(yell, blow whistle etc.)<br> 
If you are a victim of an attack, attempt to make as much commotion as possible so that you attract attention.<br> 
Have a plan in place to deal with a violent situation, if it should occur.<br> <br> 
Walk with someone else, whenever possible.<br> 
Always carry a cellular telephone (if possible).<br> 
Avoid dark, vacant, or deserted areas; use well-lit routes.<br> 
Walk near the curb on the side of the street facing traffic.<br> 
If you think you are being followed while walking, change direction and head for a well-lit area with other people around. Cross to the other side of the street rather than confront an individual alone in an isolated area.<br>
